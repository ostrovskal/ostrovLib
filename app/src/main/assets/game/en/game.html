        <h1>Game</h1>
        <p>Every time when you play a game, the condition of a game session registers. And at the subsequent start,
            game continues from the planet on which you have stopped.
        <p>In <a href="options"><img src="tool,,40,40,I_OPTIONS"></a>
            it is possible to change the system of planets. Then a game will begin with the planet on which you have stopped in this system.
        <p>At completion of a game, the state remains and fixed in <a href="select"><img src="tool,,40,40,I_SELECT_PLANET"></a>
            and in <a href="records"><img src="tool,,40,40,I_RECORD"></a>.
