    <h1>Game process</h1>


    <p>Game consists of set of <b>planets</b> from the system chosen in installations. The number of planets depends on system,
        for example, in the main <b>CLASSIC</b> system of their 30 pieces. The purpose of a game is in exempting all planets of system from monsters,
        using for this purpose make-shifts, see. <a href="desc">Game elements</a>
    <p>Starting a game, you appear on the planet on which have stopped last time, or if you play for the first time,
    you begin with the first. If in installations have changed system, then the planet on which you have stopped in this system is started.
    <h5>Game screen</h5>
    <p>The screen is divided into two parts.
    <p>In the first the planet is shown. The character of the player is marked out as  <img src="main,T_DROIDR">
    In a consequence you will operate it for passing.
    <p>In the second part, the information panel on which the current indicators of game process are shown is shown.
    <h5>Information panel</h5>
    <p><img src="game_panel">
    <p>Badges on the panel have shown the following information:
    <p><img src="main,T_SCORE,30"> the accumulated experience. At suicide bombing experience decreases
    <p><img src="main,T_FUEL,30"> I have reserved fuels
    <p><img src="main,T_TIME,30"> the remained time
    <p><img src="main,T_LIFE,30"> number of attempts
    <p><img src="main,T_BOMB,30"> stock of bombs
    <p><img src="main,T_YELLOWD,30"> quantity of yellow beings
    <p><img src="main,T_REDD,30"> quantity of red beings
    <p><img src="main,T_GREEND,30"> quantity of green beings
    <p><img src="main,T_EGG,30"> amount of eggs
    <p>It is the current status of the planet. In many respects thanks to this information, game process becomes simpler.
    <h5>Management of the droid</h5>
    <p>Clicking in any place of the screen, the icon of the <img src="cursor,,50,50"> cursor appears. Pressing his buttons there is a management of the droid.
        It or, movement, or fire. Here everything has to be intuitively clear.
        Peremeshchniye of the droid perhaps only on the so-called passable elements <img src="main,T_NULL"><img src="main,T_EARTH">
    <p> If the droid has faced <img src="main,T_BOMB"><img src="main,T_STONE">, then
        at horizontal movement it is possible to push them. It is possible to push only in "emptiness" <img src="main,T_NULL">
        At vertical movement <b>these elements aren't passable</b>
        The position of an icon of the cursor is chosen randomly and depends on that where you have clicked. It is made for convenience.
    <p>When pressing the central part of the cursor, operation - a bomb throw is performed. A bomb it is possible to throw in any the direction, but only into passable elements, see above.
        The bomb is established in the direction of the movement of the droid. It is possible to fill up a stock of bombs - look for <img src="main,T_BOMBS">
    <h5>of the Cause of death </h5>
    <p>The droid can be destroyed for the following reasons:
    <p>- Fuel has reached a limit
    <p>- Time has ended
    <p>- The droid has faced the monster, or the monster has hooked on the droid. Not all monsters lead to death.
        There are <b>harmless monsters</b> <img src="main,T_EYEG"> <img src="main,T_EYEB">, which can be a cause of death of other monsters.
    <p>- The droid has appeared in explosion epicenter, see <a href="desc">Game elements</a>
    <p>- I have fallen to the droid <img src="main,T_BOMB"> или <img src="main,T_STONE">.
        Avoid similar situations.
    <p>For prevention of some of them it is possible to take the following actions:
    <p>For prevention of end of fuel, look for <img src="main,T_FUEL">, time <img src="main,T_TIME">.
    <p>To prevent other situations - be careful and reasonably estimate the actions...
    <h5> of the Purpose</h5>
    <p>The planet can be freed only at extermination of all monsters and gathering all eggs. As soon as possible collect eggs,
        since from them other monsters can hatch. Be careful at the same time not to run into the hatched monster.
        Process of hatching is followed by <b>trembling</b> eggs
    <p>Destroy monsters using make-shifts <img src="main,T_BOMB"> or <img src="main,T_STONE">
        On bombs perish <img src="main,T_YELLOWD">. Drop stones and bombs on beings.
    <p>For faster accumulation of experience, it is better to use the bombs. In case of explosion of such bombs, everything that will get to epicenter has double effect.
        This condition is also satisfied in case of initiation of chain reaction of explosion. In a consequence it can affect your rating positively
        in <a href="records"><img src="tool,,40,40,I_RECORD"></a>
    <p>Monsters in case of collision with <img src="main,T_BOMBS"><img src="main,T_FUEL"><img src="main,T_LIFE"><img src="main,T_TIME"><img src="main,T_SCORE">
        destroy them therefore whenever possible avoid it. You appreciate resources.
    <p>Sometimes in a game there are situations in case of which the droid cannot make anything for release of the planet. For example, I stuck among stones or bombs ended,
        and monsters can be killed only with them. In this case, press <big>back</big> button twice on the device and the planet will be restarted in the initial status.
        Something like suicide. All planets are precisely passable if your actions led to a similar situation - are guilty.
        One attempt at you will be excepted or if they were not any more by then, a game will come to the end...
    <p><big>Successful game!</big>
